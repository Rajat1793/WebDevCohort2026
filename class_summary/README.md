### Day 10:
**Topic:** JavaScript Basics
**Date:** 7th February 2026
**Summary**
    In this class, we started learning the basics of JavaScript with a help of a Furniture Store story. We looked at the working of JavaScript and how work is divided by different modules and functions.
        Cutting a piece of wood - module
        Cutting a piece of wood for framing - function
        Framed product is sent to polishing - function
        Polished product is sent to packaging - function
        Quality check is done - function
    All function require some space to work and that space is called execution context and whole process is managed by the Global Execution Context. To monitor the complete flow we need a manager to look into which is called Call Stack, each step in the process is tracked and managed by the Call Stack to ensure proper execution order. A complete work is done Global execution context and Call Stack and every function has its own execution context and whenever a function is called a new execution context is created for that function and it is added to the call stack and when the function execution is completed its execution context is removed from the call stack.
    In javascript we also looked into different data types, variables, operators, conditional statements, loops, functions etc, also lokked into Hosting and scope.

**Date:** 19th February 2026
**Summary**


### Day 16:
**Topic:** Object-Oriented JavaScript
**Date:** 21st February 2026
**Summary**
This keyword ->
    Global state of this keyword depends on where its is executed, if its executed in browser then it will refer to window object and if its executed in node environment then it will refer to global object. If we use "use strict" then this keyword will be undefined.
    A regular nested function does not have access to the this keyword of its parent function. To solve this problem, we can use arrow functions, which do not have their own this and instead inherit it from the parent scope. This allows us to access the this keyword of the parent function even inside nested functions.

Detached mode ->
    when a function is called without an object reference, it is called in detached mode. In this mode, the this keyword refers to the global object (window in browsers) or is undefined in strict mode. This can lead to unexpected behavior if we are not careful when calling functions.

call apply bind -> 
    call for others
    apply for array
    bind for creating a new function with a specific this value and arguments.

new keyword ->
    The new keyword is used to create an instance of a constructor function. When we use new, it creates a new object, sets the this keyword to that object, and executes the constructor function to initialize the object.

Prototypes ->
    Prototypes are a fundamental part of JavaScript's object system. Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which is another object that it inherits properties and methods from. This allows for a powerful and flexible way to create objects and share functionality.

**Assignment:**
    1. Create our own forEach, map, filter, reduce methods for arrays.
    2. Create a pollyfill for all array methods (Flat, flatMap, slice, splice, push, pop, shift, unshift etc)
