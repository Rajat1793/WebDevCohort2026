            <strong>Summary:</strong>
            <p>In this class, we started learning the basics of JavaScript with a help of a Furniture Store story. We looked at the working of JavaScript and how work is divided by different modules and functions.
                Cutting a piece of wood - module
                Cutting a piece of wood for framing - function
                Framed product is sent to polishing - function
                Polished product is sent to packaging - function
                Quality check is done - function
            All function require some space to work and that space is called execution context and whole process is managed by the Global Execution Context. To monitor the complete flow we need a manager to look into which is called Call Stack, each step in the process is tracked and managed by the Call Stack to ensure proper execution order. A complete work is done Global execution context and Call Stack and every function has its own execution context and whenever a function is called a new execution context is created for that function and it is added to the call stack and when the function execution is completed its execution context is removed from the call stack.
            In javascript we also looked into different data types, variables, operators, conditional statements, loops, functions etc, also looked into Hosting and scope.
